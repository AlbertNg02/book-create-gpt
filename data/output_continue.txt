We have a table of content which is {table_of_contents}, now we have to expand upon each subtopic. The current subtopic that needs to be extended is {curr_topic}. Start the response with the {curr_topic} as the headline by itself on a new line. The whole output must be RAW MARKDOWN and have the {curr_topic} as an appropriate heading. Only use headings for the title and nothing else.
