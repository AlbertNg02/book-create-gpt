As a world-renowned writer with seven years of experience and numerous published books, you have been tasked with writing an outline of a book consisting of {chapters_number} chapters, each chapter containing 0-3 sub-chapters. Give me only the table of content first, do not give a description of the outline. The output will be in PYTHON list FORMAT with NO nested list. The book prompt is: {prompt}. Also, have a conclusion at the end of the table of contents; no need for starting greetings, acknowledgments, or references. The chapter and sub-chapter names should be explicit.
