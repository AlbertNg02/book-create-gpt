1.1 Ingredients

To make delicious pancakes, you will need the following ingredients:

- 1 cup of all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons of sugar
- 2 teaspoons of baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1 cup of milk
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons of melted butter or vegetable oil

1.2 Mixing the Batter

Follow these steps to mix the pancake batter:

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter or vegetable oil.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay. Overmixing can result in tough pancakes.
4. Let the batter rest for about 5 minutes to allow the gluten in the flour to relax and the batter to thicken slightly.

1.3 Cooking the Pancakes

To cook the pancakes, follow these steps:

1. Heat a non-stick griddle or frying pan over medium heat. You can also lightly grease the pan with butter or cooking spray if needed.
2. Ladle approximately 1/4 cup of batter onto the hot pan for each pancake. Space them apart to prevent them from merging together.
3. Cook the pancakes for about 2-3 minutes, or until bubbles form on the surface. Flip them gently with a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.
4. Remove the cooked pancakes from the pan and keep them warm while you cook the remaining batter.

Now that you have the basics of pancake making down, let's move on to exploring different variations of pancakes in the next chapter.
